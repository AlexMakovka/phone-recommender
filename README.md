# Phone Recommender System

A web-based phone recommendation system developed as a course project for the subject  
**“Algorithms and Technologies for Building Recommendation Systems.”**

The application is implemented in Python using Flask and demonstrates a content-based recommender system that takes user preferences and constraints into account.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system is designed to recommend smartphones based on:

- user-selected preferences (photography, gaming, video, social media, work, budget)
- constraint-based filters (price, RAM, screen size)
- analysis of device technical characteristics

Recommendations are generated by comparing real devices with an “ideal” phone profile in a normalized feature space.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- User authentication (demo accounts)
- Selection of user preferences
- Filtering by:
  - maximum price
  - minimum RAM
  - screen size range
- Top-K smartphone recommendations
- User interaction history
- Logging of user behavior for analysis

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Approach

- **Content-based recommendation system**
- Feature normalization
- Weighted Euclidean distance
- Construction of an “ideal” device profile
- Hard constraints + ranking

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- Flask
- SQLite
- HTML / CSS (Jinja2 templates)
- Git / GitHub

## 📝 Notes

- This project is an educational prototype
- No machine learning models are used
- The architecture supports future extensions
- The SQLite database file is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add collaborative filtering
- Learn feature weights from user behavior
- Implement explainable AI (recommendation explanations)
- Expand the device catalog
- Integrate machine learning models

---

## 📚 Purpose

This project can be used as:

- an educational example of a recommender system
- a foundation for a bachelor’s or master’s thesis
- a prototype of a real-world phone recommendation service
